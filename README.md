This is an (un)official swift library of the datadog API! Many more features to come, but right now it supports sending metrics and events!

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

In order to run this library you need to create a file called `datadog_config.plist` with two keys: `api_key` and `app_key`

## Installation

SwiftDog is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'SwiftDog', '~> 0.0.1'
end
```
